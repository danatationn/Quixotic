# Quixotic - Made with lots of #2f2f2f and #d9d9d9!
Oh, and love too, I guess.

The goal of this skin was to make a pleasing monochrome interface, that is also easy on the eyes and leaves little room for distractions.

## Downloads
Links are at the top of the document.

To install the nightly version, you'll need to extract the ZIP file into Quaver's skin folder.

You can find the skin folder by opening Quaver, going to the Skin settings, and hitting on the button next to the Open Skin Folder section.
It's also located at (Steam path)/steamapps/common/Quaver/Skins/.

## What's with all the skin.ini files?
Quixotic has multiple skin.ini files for multiple use cases!
To replace your skin.ini files just rename the current skin.ini to something else (e.g. "skin.ini.bak"), and then rename the one you want (e.g. "skin.ini.16.10") to "skin.ini".

Here's a nice little chart:

|Filename				|Aspect Ratio	|Upscroll|
------------------------|---------------|---------
skin.16.9.ini			|16:9			|No
skin.upscroll.ini		|16:9			|Yes
skin.16.10.ini			|16:10			|No	
skin.upscroll.16.10.ini	|16:10			|Yes
skin.universal.ini[^1]	|Any			|N/A
