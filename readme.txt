quixotic has multiple skin.ini files for multiple use cases
to replace your skin.ini files just rename the current skin.ini to something else(e.g. "skin.ini.bak"), and then rename the one you want(e.g. "skin.ini.16.10") to "skin.ini"

16:9 was tailored for 1920x1080
16:10 was tailored for 1680x1050

"skin.ini" is the default, it's meant for downscroll and a 16:9 monitor
"skin.16.9.ini" is exactly like the default skin.ini
"skin.upscroll.ini" is for people that play upscroll
"skin.16.10.ini" is for people that have 16:10 monitors   this is just for me really :)   i would buy a new monitor but they're so expensive...
"skin.upscroll.16.10.ini" is for people that play upscroll and have a 16:10 monitor--basically insane people
"skin.universal.ini" uses the default quaver skin layout and was made basically just for people with weird monitors that don't adhear to any of the other configs

that's basically it
i hope you enjoy my baby C:
