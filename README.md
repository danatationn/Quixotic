## Quixotic - Made with lots of `#2f2f2f` and `#d9d9d9`!
Oh, and love too, I guess.

## What's with all the skin.ini files?
Quixotic has multiple skin.ini files for multiple use cases!
To replace your skin.ini files just rename the current skin.ini to something else (e.g. "skin.ini.bak"), and then rename the one you want (e.g. "skin.ini.16.10") to "skin.ini".

Here's a nice little chart:

|Filename				|Aspect Ratio	|Upscroll|
------------------------|---------------|---------
skin.16.9.ini			|16:9			|No
skin.upscroll.ini		|16:9			|Yes
skin.16.10.ini			|16:10			|No	
skin.upscroll.16.10.ini	|16:10			|Yes
skin.universal.ini[^1]	|Any			|N/A
